This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Additional info

It took me around 4 hour to create the application.

I've created a few tests, just to show the flavor of the testing for such applications. It wouldn't be hard to create other tests, but it is rather time consuming and it was mentioned, that it is better not to spend a lot of time on the tests.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
